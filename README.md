Bus Reservation system

# Project Overview
The Online Bus Ticket Reservation System is a user-friendly application designed to manage bus reservations, cancellations, and status checks efficiently. It utilizes a simple command-line interface to facilitate booking, viewing, and canceling bus tickets. The system is implemented using C programming and features a straightforward approach to handle bus reservations with options for different bus classes.

# System Components
1. Data Structures:

struct datastore: Defines a structure to hold ticket information including ticket number, passenger name, age, phone number, and gender.
Arrays of struct datastore are used to manage bookings for three different buses.

# Functions:

bus(): Displays the list of available buses with their details such as source, destination, time duration, and available classes.

booking(): Handles the booking process, including seat selection and data entry for passengers. Updates the booking status and stores passenger details.

viewbus(): Provides details of each bus including departure and arrival times, ticket prices, and seat availability.

cancel(): Manages the cancellation of bookings. Allows users to cancel tickets and updates the seat status accordingly.

status(): Checks the status of a particular seat in a specific bus and displays booking details or cancellation status.

# System Functioning
